------------------------- DATA-VALID-READY CONNECTORS --------------------------

A collection of interface modules which can be used to connect different
subsystems together using the data-valid-ready convention.

FIFO:
    A simple FIFO using distributed RAM, with two parameters:
    WIDTH: The bit-width of the FIFO
    DEPTH: The log₂(FIFO depth), e.g DEPTH=3 implies a FIFO depth of 8.

CONV_8TO16:
    An adaptor which reads from an 8-bit channel and writes to a 16-bit channel.

CONV_16TO8:
    An adaptor which reads from a 16-bit channel and writes to an 8-bit channel.

CONV_8TO24 (Contributed by Joel Pérez Izquierdo):
    An adaptor which reads from an 8-bit channel and writes to an 24-bit channel.

CONV_24TO8 (Contributed by Joel Pérez Izquierdo):
    An adaptor which reads from a 24-bit channel and writes to an 8-bit channel.

CONV_40TO8:
    An adaptor which reads from a 40-bit channel and writes to an 8-bit channel.
